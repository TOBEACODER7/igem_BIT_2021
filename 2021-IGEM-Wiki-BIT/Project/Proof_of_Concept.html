                    <div class="B_content">
                        Early screening and treatment of colorectal cancer(CRC) has been proved to be conducive to
                        reducing the mortality rate of CRC. Currently, most diagnostic methods do not meet the
                        requirements of rapid, sensitive and specific screening of CRC. Based on the selection of miRNA
                        as our biomarker for its high sensitivity and specificity，we developed an ultrasensitive
                        approach for miRNA detection based on a combination of Loop-mediated isothermal
                        amplification(LAMP), CRISPR/Cas12a trans-cleavage and Slip-Chip. And in terms of hardware, in
                        order to achieve rapid, portable and simple “sample-to-response” integrated detection of CRC, we
                        constructed an intelligent interactive IVD device for large-scale early screening.

                        miRNAs, giving the potential to build standardized cancer detection platforms.

                        It can be seen that there is no significant fluorescence change in the group without LAMP
                        reaction. But strong fluorescence is detected when the ligation product was added to the
                        CRISPR/Cas12a system after LAMP amplification. According to the characteristics of the
                        CRISPR/Cas12a system, it can recognize the double-stranded ligation product and the first step
                        of the ligation product needs to undergo LAMP amplification reaction to produce double-stranded
                        structure. This proves that the LAMP amplification reaction converts miRNA into a
                        double-stranded structure recognizable by the CRISPR/Cas12a system while it can improve
                        detection sensitivity.

                        By simulating human blood sampling with fetal bovine serum, it is proved that miRNA can be

                        amplified. Finally good fluorescence value can be detected in the final CRISPR/Cas fluorescence

                        It can be obtained that the fluorescence intensity decreases as a whole according to the miRNA
                        concentration gradient. The concentration of miRNA has a linear effect on fluorescence
                        generation. The higher the miRNA concentration, the stronger the fluorescence intensity; the
                        smaller the miRNA concentration, and the lower the fluorescence curve.

                        backplane at 170℃. And verified by experiments, there is no leakage problem.

                        the pigment solution did not diffuse outside the main reaction chamber, indicating that the

                        After completing the construction of each part of the previous fluorescence detection module, we
                        conduct the overall functional test to prove whether our fluorescence detection module can
                        achieve the expected goal. The function detection of the fluorescence detection module includes:
                        the use of CRISPR/Cas12 experiment on the slip-chip; the corresponding fluorescence value is
                        obtained by fluorescence detection; the content value of miRNA is converted from the standard
                        curve; the prognostic risk score model is constructed by the content value to obtain the risk
                        classification. Our test steps and results are as follows：

                        to different pore positions, as shown in the following figure. The four hole positions of the
                        slip-chip detected as positive samples and negative samples respectively. The sample in the hole
                        is shown in Fig.21. After the experiment was completed, the fluorescence detection was performed
                        using the equipment constructed in this module to obtain the fluorescence content of the
                        positive hole.

                        because of time, we did not do the relationship curve between miRNA and fluorescence value, here
                        use the relationship curve between fluorescein sodium and fluorescence value as an alternative
                        to illustrate the problem.

                        standard curve. The fluorescence concentrations of four positive holes from top to bottom were
                        0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6 so the corresponding sample contents were 0.088, 0.059, 0.044 and 0.029,

                        Risk Score= -0.328×miR144_5p_1 + 0.496×miR193a_3p_1 + 0.578×miR126_5p_1 - 0.606×miR15b_3p_1
                        Substitute the resulting four miRNA levels into the scoring model and obtain the final risk
                        score. We can get the Ris Score is 0.008. According to the scoring rules(Score≤0.34 belongs to
                        low-risk group; 0.34＜score≤0.36 belongs to low-risk group; 0.36＜score≤0.44 belongs to
