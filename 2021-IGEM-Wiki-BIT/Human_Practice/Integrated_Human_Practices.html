                        the survival rate of CRC patients, and early screening of CRC is particularly important in clinical practice. Based on the above research results, we completed the preliminary topic selection of the project and discussed our project
                        with Professor PI Deng Yulin, Associate Professor Lv Xuefei and Professor Li Xiaoqiong. The three professors proposed the following guidance for the project:<br> 1. First of all, the professors conducted a feasibility analysis
                        of the project based on our research on the background and related detection methods of CRC and the basis of the project, which promoted us to determine the project for early screening of CRC; <br> 2. secondly, through our report,
                        the professors also pointed out the shortcomings of our current research : the integrity of the project is not enough; more inclined to the basic background of the research; there is no specific research on how to realize the specific
                        methods of early detection of CRC.

                    <div class="W_p_con">Some members of our team participated in the training course of space life science and medical engineering. Professors of IAA were invited to teach the course. The contents of the course were related to synthetic biology and microfluidic
                        chips, the application of organ chips, and so on. At the same time, we had an exchange with the synthetic biology experts in the course of this year 's iGEM project. The experts are very interested in our ideas this year, and put
                        forward some professional opinions and analysis to us, which is of great significance to the construction and promotion of our project. </div>

                    <div class="W_p_con">At the meeting, we also seized this rare opportunity to share our thoughts on this year ' s iGEM project with doctors and classmates. We talked with the doctors about the technical problems used in the project. Through the communication
                        with the teacher, we learned that the CRISPR/Cas system is not only used in the field of gene editing, but also in the field of nucleic acid diagnosis in recent years. The application has also become an upward trend. They introduced
                        us to the feasibility analysis of the biological principle of CRISPR/Cas system in nucleic acid diagnosis. Our research basically established the detection of CRC biomarker miRNA to achieve early detection of CRC. Therefore, we
                        determined to investigate the application of CRISPR/Cas system in the detection of miRNA. Secondly, the hardware aspect puts forward the problem of whether it can be related to the equipment in the information age, which makes
                        us think that our project should also be further deepened in integrity and practicability.</div>

                    <div class="W_p_con">Based on the above viewpoints, we have carried on the thinking and discussion, and the literature research has finally determined the detection of miRNA based on isothermal amplification CRISPR system. At the same time, we have designed
                        an intelligent, highly interactive detection system based on smartphones and sliding chips. At the same time, we have also learned many other applications about synthetic biology and will discuss divergent thinking in the subsequent
                        development of the project.

                    <div class="W_p_con"> First of all, two team leaders reported on the 2021 project, during which LZU-CHINA team asked us many constructive questions：</div>
                    <div class="W_p_con">“miRNA expression was high in exosomes.,does your project require exosome extraction and how to extract exosomes? </div>
                    <div class="W_p_con">“ Can miRNA be directly amplified as a sample?” </div>
                    <div class="W_p_con">These problems also guide us to think about where we are not fully considered, and provide a good idea for the improvement of our project. The exchange of experimental experience and lessons between the two teams helped us to improve
                        the experimental program. </div>


                    <div class=W_p_title3> Suggestions of BIT-China</div>

                    <div class="W_p_con">1. In terms of team management, BIT-China put forward their views, they believe that the task is assigned to different heads, the head of the small center to carry out the project, and then report to the head of the center will be
                        more efficient; </div>

                    <div class="W_p_con">2. In terms of project technology, they are very interested in the miRNA detection of CRISPR/Cas system but they also see our shortcomings, and propose that a variety of CRISPR /Cas systems can be compared to achieve the optimization
                        and convenience of miRNA detection. </div>

                    <div class=W_p_title3>Discussion and cooperation with YiYe_China</div>

                    <div class="W_p_con">.Both of our two teams carried out early screening for CRC. Through the communication, we complemented the methods of the two teams and exchanged them to the feasibility of technology. miRNA is a single chain that enables CRISPR\Cas12
                        system to identify and work. The cooperation and communication with team YiYe_China improved our understanding and design of the project.</div>

                    <div class="W_p_con">2.At the same time, according to the analysis of the questionnaire, we started the planning of the first online popular science lecture on CRC. On July 30, we cooperated with Bilibili to carry out the online popular science lecture
                        on CRC. This lecture popularized the knowledge of CRC to the public, so that the public can understand CRC better, and help us obtain the improvement suggestions of the project, which expanded the public influence of iGEM.</div>

                    <div class="W_p_con">Moreover, we continued to hold two lectures and invited the other three teams to carry out publicity with us. We held a joint popular science lecture with BIT-China, iBowu-China and BUCT-China. Four teams combined online and offline
                        to explain why ethics is so important. In this lecture, we discussed ethical issues together, which is helpful to strengthen our understanding of basic experimental safety and experimental ethical codes in the experimental design
                        process. At the same time, the participating students were very interested in our lectures and asked many questions : </div>

                    <div class="W_p_con">In order to push the knowledge and charm of iGEM into middle school education, we went to Beijing Yucai Middle School. In the lecture, our team leader Liu Zhoumi introduced iGEM and synthetic biology to middle school students who are
                        full of unknown but full of imagination about iGEM. He all introduced our team and our project, so that students have a deeper understanding of iGEM. During the lecture, he also linked synthetic biology with the interesting project
                        of iGEM to arouse students' divergent thinking and helped them better understand synthetic biology. </div>

                    <div class="W_p_con">According to the data background investigation, we know that the 5-year survival rate of young patients with rectal cancer aged 20-40 years old and elderly patients with rectal cancer aged 60-80 years old in stage I, II, III and IV
                        has a significant decreasing trend. Most patients with CRC have reached the middle and late stages of the tumor at the time of diagnosis, so that patients miss the best treatment period and about 15 % ~ 25 % of them cried for liver
                        metastasis at the time of diagnosis. More than 80 % of the liver metastases can not be radical resection. Therefore, improving the proportion of early diagnosis is considered to be the key to improving the survival rate of patients
                        with colorectal cancer. Early screening of CRC is particularly important in clinical practice. At the same time, in our questionnaire, the masses are extremely expecting for the early screening of CRC, because based on the early
                        screening of CRC, it can help to detect tumors in the early stage and remove local cancerous sites or precancerous lesions ( adenomatous polyps ) to effectively prevent and improve the occurrence and prognosis of CRC. The stage
                        diagnosis of CRC can greatly improve the survival rate of patients, thereby reducing the occurrence of tumor metastasis. Our project has carried out a systematic experimental design based on the early screening of colorectal cancer
                        and the product is realized to make our contribution to the early screening of CRC. Put forward our ideas and contributions for early screening of CRC, effectively prevent and improve the occurrence of CRC, and cooperate with doctors
                        to make early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, greatly improve the survival rate of patients.</div>

                    <div class="W_p_con">Through literature research, public information feedback and other preliminary research, we have counted the data. These results give us confidence in the implementation of this year’ s project, and let us determine that this year’
                        s project has practical significance and is required by the public.</div>
                    <div class="W_p_con">According to the results of previous research, we also determined that we should carry out relevant project science lectures to help more people understand CRC, its detection methods and the trend of synthetic biology. And at the same
                        time enter the student classroom for the dissemination of synthetic biology.</div>
                    <div class="W_p_con">In the project, we have carried out a variety of HP activities to help us collect feedback and help us improve the project. Through the exchange of other teams, asking for advice from experts and scholars and collecting feedback from
                        the audience, we continuously improve and perfected the project. The biological hardware and other parts of our project are also constantly improving and perfecting.</div>
                    <div class="W_p_con">It is through these HP activities that we can gain the opinions of different groups of people, which help us improve our project. And we can also play our social role to help the public understand this disease.</div>

                    <div class=W_p_title2>In the future</div>

                    <div class="W_p_con">Based on the HP that has been carried out, we think about the future development of the project. Compared with the existing miRNA detection technology projects, the project has the characteristics of high sensitivity and high specificity
                        to meet the needs of miRNA detection. At the same time, combined with the hardware foundation and mobile phone information technology, we finally build an integrated, portable and intelligent auxiliary diagnosis system for CRC.
                        The miRNA we choose is the object with a high correlation with CRC according to the results of literature research and modeling analysis.</div>

                    <div class="W_p_con">The platform they designed is a general-purpose miRNA analysis platform, so miRNA targets for different diseases can be analyzed to provide diagnostic references for other diseases besides early diagnosis of CRC. In the future, we
                        hope to broaden the scope of application of this project and make more contributions to human health.</div>
