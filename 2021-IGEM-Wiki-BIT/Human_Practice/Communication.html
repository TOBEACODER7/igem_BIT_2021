                    <div class="W_p_con">In this part, team BIT carry out Education & Communication activities this year based on the principles of "online and offline ", "interview and return visit", and "educate and being educated". In this part, we believe that while communicating
                        with the public and conducting popular science publicity, we should also communicate with experts, scholars and other iGEM teams. Communicating with experts and scholars will help us improve our knowledge level so we can be able
                        to conduct popular science publicity more professionally; communicating with other teams will help us exchange experience in popular science publicity so we can assist each other in conducting popular science together, which can
                        play a better role Effect.</div>

                    <div class="W_p_con">Therefore, in the Education & Communication section, we have not only carried out traditional popular science publicity measures such as conducting science popularization lectures for college and middle school students, conducting
                        popular science publicity to the public and network publicity such as video publicity at Bilibili and public science publicity through WeChat public account. We have also worked hard to improve our professional knowledge and participated
                        in activities such as space training courses, medical-industrial integration forums and visits to the Bluepha. Not only that, we are also actively getting in touch with other iGEM teams to jointly carry out popular science publicity.

                    <div class="W_p_con">In this offline salon, we introduced the meaning and pursuit of iGEM competition, our team BIT and our projects to the students. By introducing our projects and promoting iGEM, we analyzed the advantages of participating in the iGEM
                        competition from the perspective of individual participation: systematically learned synthetic biology, promoted by learning different skills. Also we harvest strong friendships. We tell our story in iGEM from the most simple point
                        of view, so that more students can understand iGEM and how they can grow in iGEM. In the salon, we answer the questions of the participants about iGEM and expand the public influence of iGEM.</div>
                    <div class="W_p_con">The salon aroused students’ interest in synthetic biology and also opened the door of iGEM for everyone. After the salon, some students also stayed alone to learn about iGEM in detail with us. The students showed their interest in
                        synthetic biology and our team. We believe they will become iGEMer in the future. </div>

                        had colorectal cancer patients. We hope that the lecture can help everyone learn more about colorectal cancer and how to prevent the occurrence of colorectal cancer.</div>

                        integrated in the project. It gave the students a deeper understanding of iGEM and our team. The interaction with the students aroused mutual discussion and at the same time The students are curious about the new subject of synthetic

                    <div class="W_p_con">On the premise that the first two lectures were effective, we invited four iGEM teams to jointly hold the third joint science lecture. The other three participating teams were BIT-China, iBowu-China and BUCT-China. The four teams used
                        online and offline methods to explain why ethics is so important; artificial meat-the ethical issues of the future popularization of food science; ethical controversies of artificial life; ethical issues in organ transplantation.
                        In this lecture, we discussed ethical issues together, which is very helpful to strengthen our understanding of basic experimental safety and experimental ethics codes in the process of experimental design. At the same time, the
                        students who participated are very helpful to our lectures. Interests, raised a series of questions such as "What will the taste of artificial meat be like?", "The ethical issues involved in animal organ transplantation in organ
                        transplantation", etc. The discussion process is a collision of various wonderful ideas. Students can also have a deeper understanding of the content of our lectures.</div>

                    <div class="W_p_con">During the interaction, the students asked us many interesting questions such as "Did Spider-Man undergo genetic engineering changes?", "Then we can resurrect people from the dead through synthetic biology" and so on. These little
                        questions seem "strange" but in fact it is the children's yearning for the unknown world. Their thinking is very valuable. Under our science popularization, the students showed their curiosity and interest in iGEM and synthetic
                        biology. We believe some of them will become iGEMer when they become high school students.</div>

                        is aimed at the "target audience". Through this live broadcast, we can let them know more about colorectal cancer. So we can introduce our project to them and broaden the audience base of the product. </div>
